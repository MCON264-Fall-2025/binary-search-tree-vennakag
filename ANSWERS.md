1. The inorder method runs visits the left, root, and right. The smallest elements are on the left, the highest elements are on the right, and the root is somewhere in between. This method starts by going to the most left root and keeps going higher until it get to the root and then goes down the right subtree until it gets to the most right root which is how the elements end up being in sorted order.
2. A bst becomes highly unbalanced when the insertion order is sorted which creates on straight line to the right. the inorder traversal would look like the insertion order.
3. a. Recursive traversals are methods that call themselves many times until the best cases are reached while iterative traversals iterate through the tree using pointers, if statements, and while loops.
   b. Breadth-first traversal is where you traverse the nodes of the tree level by level whereas depth-first is where each node is traverse always down to its last root before iterating any adjacent roots.
4. Using breadth-first would be best for maze games where the safest move would be to check all possible next moves as opposed to going deep down into own path, getting stuck, and having to go back to the root you were working with.
